# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Inspector is a comprehensive HTTP request monitoring and analysis tool designed to capture, display, and export HTTP traffic for debugging and development purposes. This tool provides developers with real-time visibility into API requests, enabling them to inspect headers, parameters, body content, and analyze request patterns through an interactive dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to capture all incoming HTTP requests regardless of method type, so that I can monitor and debug API traffic in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any HTTP request is made to the inspector endpoint THEN the system SHALL capture the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
2. WHEN a request contains query parameters THEN the system SHALL capture and store all query parameter key-value pairs
3. WHEN a request contains headers THEN the system SHALL capture and store all request headers
4. WHEN a request contains a body THEN the system SHALL capture and store the complete request body content
5. WHEN a request is captured THEN the system SHALL timestamp the request with precise date and time
6. WHEN multiple requests are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without data loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an interactive dashboard to view captured requests, so that I can easily browse and analyze HTTP traffic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a list of all captured requests in chronological order
2. WHEN I click on a request in the list THEN the system SHALL display detailed request information including method, URL, headers, query parameters, and body
3. WHEN new requests are captured THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time without requiring manual refresh
4. WHEN viewing request details THEN the system SHALL format JSON and XML content for improved readability
5. WHEN the request list becomes long THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or scrolling functionality
6. WHEN I want to filter requests THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities by method, URL pattern, or timestamp

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export captured request data in multiple formats, so that I can analyze the data in external tools or share it with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a JSON export THEN the system SHALL generate a properly formatted JSON file containing all captured request data
2. WHEN I request a CSV export THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with columns for timestamp, method, URL, headers, query parameters, and body
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, request method, or URL pattern
4. WHEN an export is requested THEN the system SHALL provide download functionality through the web interface
5. WHEN exporting large datasets THEN the system SHALL handle memory efficiently to prevent application crashes
6. WHEN export files are generated THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as export timestamp and filter criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time statistics about captured requests, so that I can quickly understand traffic patterns and system usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are captured THEN the system SHALL display total request count in real-time
2. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show breakdown by HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
3. WHEN analyzing traffic THEN the system SHALL display request frequency over time periods
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL show average response times if available
5. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL update counters and charts in real-time
6. WHEN statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide time-based filtering (last hour, day, week)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API Inspector to integrate seamlessly with the existing DevBoost application, so that I can access it through the familiar tool interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DevBoost application loads THEN the API Inspector SHALL appear as an available tool in the tools list
2. WHEN I select the API Inspector tool THEN the system SHALL launch the inspector interface within the application window
3. WHEN using the API Inspector THEN the interface SHALL follow the existing application's styling and design patterns
4. WHEN the inspector is running THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of server status and port information
5. WHEN closing the inspector THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup server resources and stop background processes
6. WHEN the inspector encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages consistent with the application's error handling
