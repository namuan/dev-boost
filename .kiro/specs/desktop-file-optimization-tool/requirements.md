# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Desktop File Optimization Tool is a desktop application designed for on-demand file optimization that compresses user-uploaded images, videos, and PDFs to reduce file sizes with minimal quality loss. The tool focuses on making large files smaller for faster sharing while maintaining usability. The application follows the tagline "Copy large, paste small, send fast" and automatically saves optimized files alongside source files for immediate use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and optimize various file formats (images, videos, PDFs) so that I can reduce file sizes with minimal quality loss for faster sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file (PNG, JPEG, GIF, HEIC, TIFF) THEN the system SHALL optimize it using appropriate compression algorithms
2. WHEN a user uploads a video file (MOV, etc.) THEN the system SHALL compress it while maintaining acceptable quality
3. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL optimize it to reduce file size
4. WHEN a user provides a file path THEN the system SHALL process the file at that location
5. WHEN a user provides a URL to a supported file THEN the system SHALL download and optimize the file
6. WHEN a user provides a base64-encoded image THEN the system SHALL decode and optimize it
7. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL save the optimized file alongside the source file
8. WHEN optimization fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to downscale images and videos to specific resolutions so that I can further reduce file sizes for different sharing contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects downscaling options THEN the system SHALL provide incremental scaling from 90% to 10% of original resolution
2. WHEN a user clicks floating buttons for quick downscaling THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the selected scaling percentage
3. WHEN downscaling is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio unless specified otherwise
4. WHEN downscaling is complete THEN the system SHALL update the file size preview
5. IF the user specifies custom resolution values THEN the system SHALL apply those exact dimensions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic format conversion for less compatible formats so that my optimized files work across different platforms and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a HEIC file THEN the system SHALL convert it to JPEG format during optimization
2. WHEN a user uploads a TIFF file THEN the system SHALL convert it to PNG or JPEG format
3. WHEN a user uploads a MOV file THEN the system SHALL convert it to MP4 format
4. WHEN format conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL use the most widely supported equivalent format
5. WHEN conversion settings are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to customize format preferences
6. WHEN original files are processed THEN the system SHALL store them in a backup folder accessible via app menu

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to my original files and backup management so that I can recover unoptimized versions when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are optimized THEN the system SHALL create backup copies of original files
2. WHEN a user accesses the app menu THEN the system SHALL provide access to the backup folder
3. WHEN a user views backup files THEN the system SHALL display file names, sizes, and optimization dates
4. WHEN backup storage exceeds a threshold THEN the system SHALL notify users about storage usage
5. IF a user deletes backup files THEN the system SHALL confirm the action before permanent deletion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback on optimization progress and results so that I understand the impact of the optimization process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN optimization is in progress THEN the system SHALL show current processing status
3. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL display original vs optimized file sizes
4. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL show percentage reduction achieved
5. WHEN multiple files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show individual and overall progress
6. IF optimization takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to integrate seamlessly with my desktop workflow so that I can quickly optimize files without disrupting my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality for file uploads
2. WHEN optimized files are created THEN the system SHALL make them immediately available for use in other applications
3. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimal resource footprint
4. WHEN files are optimized THEN the system SHALL preserve file metadata where appropriate
5. IF the system encounters unsupported file types THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about supported formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable optimization settings so that I can balance file size reduction with quality requirements for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL provide quality level controls for each file type
2. WHEN quality settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply them to subsequent optimizations
3. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL use pngquant for PNG optimization
4. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL use jpegoptim for JPEG optimization
5. WHEN processing GIFs THEN the system SHALL use gifsicle for optimization
6. WHEN processing videos THEN the system SHALL use ffmpeg for compression
7. WHEN processing PDFs THEN the system SHALL use ghostscript for optimization
8. IF libvips is available THEN the system SHALL use it for image resizing operations
9. WHEN converting videos to GIFs THEN the system SHALL use gifski for high-quality conversion
